### ðŸ˜º Play here: [Catsweeper](https://saralotfi.github.io/catsweeper/)

# Background
Based on the classic game, Minesweeper. I tried to recreate the game mechanics as close to the classic as possible. The design is based on my own illustrations.

# How to play
The board is divided into tiles. There may be a cat behind a tile or not. Your goal to open/sweep all tiles with no cat behind. If you click on a cat tile you lose. If you open all other tiles, you win.

When you left-click on a tile with no cat, it will show how many cats are surrounding that tile; use this to help you. If that number is none, the tile will cascade and open up adjacent tiles with no surrounding cats.

You can also right-click tiles to flag them as an indicator to yourself that you think there is a cat there. (The flag is in the shape of a toy, keeping any hidden cat occupied ðŸ˜‰) At the start of the game, you are given as many toys as there are cats. The top-left counter is your toys left.

Click the restart button to restart the game.
